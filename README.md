## Features

### Dark Mode

Done can be used in either dark or light mode. Dark mode is enabled by default. To turn dark mode off, click the menu icon and toggle dark mode off.

### Tags

Tags can be added to every to-do. They make it easier to manage your to-dos by categorizing them. To add a tag to a to-do, click on the tag icon and select a tag from the list. Then, add or save the to-do. The following tags are available:

- Personal
- Work
- Shopping
- Errand
- Home
- Important

### Due Date

A due date can be added to every to-do. Adding due dates to your to-dos can help you prioritize them and quickly see when they are due. To add a due date to a to-do, click on the calendar icon and select a day from the calendar. Next, add or save the to-do.

### Filters & Sorting

To-dos can be filtered and sorted. By default, the filters section is hidden. To view it, click the menu icon and then click the 'Show filters' menu item. To hide filters again, just click on the 'Hide filters' menu item.

You can filter to-dos by display type and tags. By default, all to-dos are displayed. You can filter them by their done status if you only want to see 'Not done' or 'Done' todos. Click on a display type button to change this. To filter to-dos by tag, click on the tags in the list.

### Delete & Reset

If you ever want to delete all your to-dos or reset the app, click on the menu icon and select the appropriate menu item from the Danger Zone. A modal will appear to confirm the action.

### Local Storage

To-dos and app settings are saved in the browser using local storage. None of your data is shared with external APIs or servers. This means that your to-dos will appear in the app so long as you don't clear site data from the browser. This also means that you can't share your data across multiple browsers. Therefore, you might want to use Done on your smartphone for personal to-dos and on your computer for work to-dos.
